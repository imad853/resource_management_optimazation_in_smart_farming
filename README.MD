# Intelligent Agent for Resource Management Optimization in Smart Farming

## Overview
This repository contains an intelligent agent designed to optimize resource management in smart farming. The agent leverages search algorithms to enhance efficiency in water usage, fertilizer application, and irrigation. By integrating sensor data and heuristic search techniques, the system ensures optimal resource distribution while minimizing waste and maximizing crop yield.

## Aim
Develop an AI-driven system that optimizes resource management in smart farming, including water usage, fertilizer application, and irrigation, by applying search techniques (Greedy, A*, and Genetic Algorithms) and Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP) to minimize resource waste and maximize crop yield.

## Features
- **Search-Based Optimization**: Implements Greedy Search, A* Search, Genetic Algorithms, and CSP for resource allocation
- **Automated Irrigation**: Optimizes water distribution based on environmental conditions.
- **Fertilizer Optimization**: Ensures efficient fertilizer application based on soil nutrient content and crop type.
- **Crop Health Monitoring**: Uses heuristic-based techniques to detect plant deficiencies.
- **Scalability**: Works with different farm sizes and resource constraints.

## Problem Definition
The objective of this project is to develop an AI system that optimizes the management of resources (water, fertilizer, irrigation) in smart farming. The system should minimize resource usage while maximizing crop yield and maintaining crop health.

### Resource Optimization
- Determine the optimal amount of water, fertilizer, and irrigation required for different crops, growth stages, and environmental conditions.

### Irrigation Scheduling
- Optimize the irrigation schedule to ensure the crops receive the appropriate amount of water without over-irrigating, based on soil moisture and environmental factors.

### Fertilizer Usage
- Optimize fertilizer application based on soil nutrient content and crop type to ensure maximum yield without overuse of fertilizers.

## Constraints & Objective Function
### Constraints
- Define proper levels of water usage, soil moisture, and fertilizer application.
- Account for crop type, growth stage, and environmental conditions.

### Objective Function
- **Minimize Resource Waste**: Reduce the overall usage of water, fertilizer, and irrigation while ensuring optimal crop growth.
- **Maximize Crop Yield**: Allocate resources efficiently to achieve the highest possible crop yield.
- **Optimize Sustainability**: Ensure a sustainable resource management plan that minimizes environmental impact.

## Search Strategy Implementation
### Greedy Search
- Implements a Greedy algorithm to select the best resource allocation at each step based on the current soil and environmental conditions.
- Prioritizes the most pressing resource needs (e.g., water for crops in dry conditions) and allocates resources accordingly.

### A* (or IDA*) Search
- Uses A* Search to explore possible resource management solutions while considering constraints and weighted importance of each condition (e.g., water availability, fertilizer needs, and soil moisture levels).
- Finds the optimal solution by evaluating the total "cost" of resource allocation across multiple steps.

### Genetic Algorithms (GA)
- Implements Genetic Algorithms to evolve better resource management strategies over multiple generations.
- Each generation represents a set of potential resource allocation plans, refined using genetic operators to improve efficiency.

### Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)
- Models the resource management problem as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP).
  - **Constraints**: Ensure each cropâ€™s resource requirements are met without exceeding optimal usage limits.
  - **Objective**: Maximize crop yield while minimizing total resource usage.

## Comparative Evaluation
### Performance Comparison
- Compare the performance of Greedy Search, A*, Genetic Algorithms, and CSP-based methods in optimizing resource management.
- Evaluate the quality of the resource allocation in terms of crop yield, water usage, fertilizer efficiency, and sustainability.
- Compare the computational efficiency of each approach, particularly in terms of scalability when handling larger datasets.

### Success Criteria
- The system should accurately allocate water, fertilizer, and irrigation resources to maximize crop yield while minimizing waste.
- The resource allocation should respect environmental and soil constraints while being computationally efficient.
